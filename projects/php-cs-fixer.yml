    The PHP Coding Standards Fixer tool fixes most issues in your code when you
    want to follow the PHP coding standards as defined in the PSR-1 and PSR-2
    documents and many more. If you are already using a linter to identify coding
    standards problems in your code, you know that fixing them by hand is tedious.
    This tool does not only detect them, but also fixes them for you.
