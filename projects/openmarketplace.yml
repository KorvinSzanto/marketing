    OpenMarketplace is the first open-source MVM engine built on top of Sylius and Symfony components. 
    It provides a set of useful marketplace features such as vendor registration, listings, orders and 
    conversation management in a headless environment. It is fully compatible with all Sylius plugins and
    Symfony bundles. The project follows the common Symfony/Sylius coding practices making it highly flexible
    and easy to start with for any PHP developer.
