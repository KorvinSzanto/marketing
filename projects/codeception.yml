    Codeception is a full-stack testing framework which incorporates
    acceptance, functional, and unit testing. It uses a simple PHP DSL to
    describe test scenarios and includes over 20 modules to solve common
    problems. With Codeception you can get tests executed inside every
    popular PHP framework, use PhpBrowser (based on Guzzle), or run
    acceptance tests with Selenium WebDriver.
