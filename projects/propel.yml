    Propel is an open-source Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) for SQL-
    Databases in PHP 5.4. It allows you to access your database using a
    set of objects, providing a simple API for storing and retrieving
    data. But not only plain ORM but it also provides database schema
    migration, reverse engineering of existing database and much more.
