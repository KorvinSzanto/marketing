    Bref is an open source project that brings full support for PHP and its
    frameworks to AWS Lambda. Getting started with serverless can be overwhelming.
    Bref integrates with the open-source Serverless Framework for configuration
    and deployment. We get the best of both world: powerful, yet simple.
