    PHPMailer is a full-featured email creation and transfer class for PHP. Used
    by many popular open-source projects, it can send emails without a local
    mail server. It supports DKIM and S/MIME signing and SMTP authentication
    with LOGIN, PLAIN, NTLM, CRAM-MD5 and Google's XOAUTH2 mechanisms over SSL
    and TLS transports.
